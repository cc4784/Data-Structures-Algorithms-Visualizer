# Data-Structures-Algorithms-Visualizer
An interactive web app that visually demonstrates how common data structures and algorithms work step-by-step.

## Installation
Download files from repository and open...

## Goals
Help users understand DSA concepts visually.
Build something engaging that showcases both frontend and CS fundamentals.

## Key Features to Implement
Algorithms
Sorting: Bubble, Merge, Quick, Insertion.

Pathfinding: Dijkstraâ€™s, A*, BFS, DFS.

Searching: Binary Search (with visual step-by-step comparisons).

Data Structures
Arrays / Linked Lists: Insertion, deletion, traversal animations.

Stacks & Queues: Push/pop operations, use animation to show structure changes.

Trees: Binary Search Tree with insert, delete, traversal.

Graphs: Visualize traversal (DFS/BFS), shortest paths.
